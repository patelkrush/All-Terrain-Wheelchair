# All-Terrain-Wheelchair
Designed a mobility aid that helped people move more comfortably across uneven ground. Together along with four other group members, I contributed to the creation of this design. For almost four months, we worked on this design to ensure that the individual utilizing our mobility device could do so safely and easily.
